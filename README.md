# RSSfeeder

Install:
```
chmod +x install.sh
./install
```

Start Server:
```
shotgun
```

Downfalls:

- Database Cleaner isn't setup properly and one test might fail
- Sequel doesn't return object so the JSON responses aren't optimal
- JS code is verbose and can be refactored but that's not the focus of the app
